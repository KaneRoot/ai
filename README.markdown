# artificial intelligence training

Hey, you wanna try to create a good AI and kick some asses ? Here some games
with a simple goal : let you improve your skills at creating algorithms.


## chevaliers

Two players, four avatars, the possibility to attack or defend and that's all !

The game : you have a square map, and you control two avatars. One on the top,
on one side, and one on the bottom on the other side. With each avatar you can
attack horizontally or vertically, and defend horizontally or vertically.
Example :

    | O d a a   X |
    |           d |
    |             |
    |             |
    |           d |
    | X d a a   O |

Here, the player 1 (the « O » avatars) defends and attacks horizontally for the
avatar on the top, and for the avatar on the bottom, he defends vertically and
attacks horizontally.

The server and a client (with a dumb algo) are provided. The client is only an
example, feel free to use whatever language you want !
